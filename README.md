# DogClassificationUsingCoreMLAndVision
Swift project for applying Core ML and Vision :)

Firslty let us take a look on [the Machine learning](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=whats+the+meaning+of+machin+learning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) concept ---->

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves

Now we can ask how to apply this concept?
By using a set of data we can generate a A mathmetical model using some algorithms.
